BareMetal OS -- a 64-bit OS written in Assembly for x86-64 systems

BareMetal is a 64-bit protected mode operating system for x86-64 compatible
PCs, written entirely in assembly language, which boots from a hard drive. It
features a command-line, support for FAT16 hard drives and sound via the PC
speaker. It can load external programs and has over 60 system calls. BareMetal
can also utilize all available CPU's in the computer it is run on.

At the moment there is no plan to BareMetal into a general-purpose operating
system like Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux; it is designed as a learning tool,
to demonstrate how a simple OS works. One idea for BareMetal is to be used as
a base for raw number crunching applications, perhaps even in a cluster
enviroment. You can use it as the basis of your own OS project, or to learn
about x86 assembly language. The complete documentation for BareMetal,
including instructions on running it, building it and writing your own
operating system, can be found in manual.html in the doc/ directory.

Have fun and happy hacking!
